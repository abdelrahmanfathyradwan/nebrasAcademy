      answer: "Islam commands kindness and prohibits rudeness. The Prophet (ﷺ) warned: 'Being undutiful to parents is among the greatest major sins' (Bukhari 2654). Even saying 'uff' (a word of disrespect) is forbidden (Surah Al-Isra 17:23)."
    },
    {
      question: "Are children financially responsible for their parents?",
      answer: "Yes, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'You and your wealth belong to your father' (Ibn Majah 2291). This includes providing for parents' needs when required."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the proper way to speak to parents?",
      answer: "The Quran commands: 'Speak to them a noble word' (Surah Al-Isra 17:23). The Prophet (ﷺ) promised: 'Looking at parents with affection earns the reward of an accepted Hajj for every glance' (Bayhaqi, Shu'ab al-Iman 7835)."
    },
    {
      question: "How can children honor parents after their death?",
      answer: "By making dua: 'My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small' (Surah Al-Isra 17:24). The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Fulfilling their promises and maintaining their ties of kinship continues their rights' (Abu Dawood 5142)."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does Islam emphasize the mother's rights specifically?",
      answer: "A man asked the Prophet (ﷺ) three times who deserved best treatment, getting 'your mother' each time before 'your father' (Bukhari 5971). This reflects her greater sacrifices in pregnancy, birth, and upbringing."
    },
    {
      question: "What special status do mothers have in Islam?",
      answer: "The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Paradise is beneath the mother's feet' (Ibn Majah 2781), and her supplications are among the most accepted prayers (Tirmidhi 1905)."
    },
    {
      question: "How does Islam view caring for elderly parents?",
      answer: "It's obligatory. The Prophet (ﷺ) cursed those who neglect aging parents: 'May he be humiliated who doesn't enter Paradise by serving them' (Muslim 2551)."
    },
    {
      question: "Can parents' rights conflict with Islamic teachings?",
      answer: "If parents demand disobedience to Allah, 'do not obey them' (Surah Al-Ankabut 29:8), but still maintain respectful conduct."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the rewards for honoring parents?",
      answer: "The Prophet (ﷺ) mentioned: 'Extended lifespan, increased provisions' (Bukhari 5986), forgiveness of sins, and elevation in Paradise through a child's righteous deeds (Muslim 1631)."

  title: "What are the Islamic sacred months, and why are they called that?",
  image: "/images/sacredMonths.jfif",
  excerpt: "Islamic sacred months are more than just names on the Hijri calendar—they are special seasons of peace ...",
  content: [
    {
      question: "Which months are considered sacred in Islam?",
      answer: "The four sacred months are: Dhul-Qi'dah, Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram, and Rajab. Allah states in the Quran: 'Indeed, the number of months with Allah is twelve... of these, four are sacred' (Quran 9:36). The Prophet (ﷺ) specified them in Sahih al-Bukhari (3197)."
    },
    {
      question: "Why are these months called 'sacred'?",
      answer: "They hold special sanctity because Allah: 1) Prohibited warfare during them (even in pre-Islamic times), 2) Made sins more serious and good deeds more rewarded, and 3) Designated them for spiritual focus as stated in Quran 9:36: 'So do not wrong yourselves during them.'"
    },
    {
      question: "What makes Dhul-Hijjah unique among sacred months?",
      answer: "Dhul-Hijjah contains Hajj (the 5th pillar of Islam) and Eid al-Adha. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'There are no days on which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days' (first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah) - Sahih al-Bukhari 969."
    },
    {
      question: "How should Muslims observe Muharram?",
      answer: "1) Fasting on Ashura (10th Muharram) which expiates past year's sins (Sahih Muslim 1162), 2) Reflecting on the sacrifice of Imam Hussain, and 3) Starting the Islamic year with repentance. The Prophet (ﷺ) called it 'The Month of Allah' showing its sanctity."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the significance of Rajab?",
      answer: "Rajab marks spiritual preparation for Ramadan and is associated with Isra & Mi'raj. While no specific rituals are mandated, the Prophet's companions often fasted voluntarily during it to draw closer to Allah."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there prohibited actions during sacred months?",
      answer: "All forms of injustice are especially forbidden. The Quran's command 'do not wrong yourselves' (9:36) applies to: 1) Physical violence, 2) Verbal abuse, 3) Neglecting worship, and 4) Social conflicts - making these months a time for peace."
    },
    {
      question: "How do sacred months affect worship rewards?",
      answer: "Good deeds are multiplied, particularly: 1) Fasting (especially in Muharram - Sahih Muslim 1163), 2) Charity, 3) Quran recitation, and 4) Dhikr. Sins also carry greater weight during these months."
    },
    {
      question: "Did pre-Islamic Arabs honor these months?",
      answer: "Yes, tribes would cease wars during sacred months for safe trade and travel. Islam preserved this tradition but elevated it from cultural practice to divine commandment with spiritual purpose."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I make up missed fasts in sacred months?",
      answer: "Yes, and it's highly recommended. The Prophet (ﷺ) emphasized: 'The best fast after Ramadan is in Muharram' (Sahih Muslim 1163), making these months ideal for compensating missed obligations."
    },
    {
      question: "How can children learn about sacred months?",
      answer: "1) Marking them on Islamic calendars, 2) Sharing stories of associated events (e.g., Hajj, Ashura), 3) Encouraging good deeds like charity, and 4) Explaining their historical continuity from Prophet Ibrahim's time."

  title: "Tafsir of Surah Al-Kawthar Meaning and Lessons",
  image: "/images/heroImg.jfif",
  excerpt: "Surah Al-Kawthar in English is the 108th chapter of the Quran and the shortest surah, consisting of just three verses ...",
  content: [
    {
      question: "What is the meaning of 'Al-Kawthar' mentioned in this surah?",
      answer: "Al-Kawthar refers to: 1) A river in Paradise granted exclusively to the Prophet (ﷺ) (Sahih al-Bukhari 6581), 2) Abundant blessings including his prophethood and eternal legacy, and 3) The Fountain of Kawthar where believers will drink on Judgment Day (Sahih Muslim 2292). Ibn Kathir interprets it as encompassing all forms of divine goodness."
    },
    {
      question: "Why was Surah Al-Kawthar revealed?",
      answer: "It was revealed in Makkah when the Quraysh mocked the Prophet (ﷺ) after his sons' deaths, calling him 'Abtar' (cut off from lineage). Allah responded by promising him eternal honor while his enemies would be forgotten (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the three main commands in this surah?",
      answer: "1) Recognize Allah's gifts ('We have granted you Al-Kawthar'), 2) Express gratitude through worship ('Pray to your Lord and sacrifice'), and 3) Trust divine justice ('Your enemy is truly cut off')."
    },
    {
      question: "How does this surah comfort believers facing hardship?",
      answer: "It teaches that Allah's blessings outweigh worldly losses. Though the Prophet (ﷺ) faced mockery for having no living sons, Allah ensured his spiritual progeny (Ummah) would multiply forever - proving true success comes from faith, not material status."
    },
    {
      question: "What hadith describe the Kawthar River in Paradise?",
      answer: "The Prophet (ﷺ) said: 'Its water is whiter than milk, sweeter than honey, with birds whose necks resemble camels' (Sunan At-Tirmidhi 2543). In another narration: 'Its banks are domes of hollow pearls' (Sahih al-Bukhari 6581)."
    },
    {
      question: "How is the Fountain of Kawthar different from the River?",
      answer: "The River exists in Paradise, while the Fountain will appear on Judgment Day. The Prophet (ﷺ) described it as having 'cups as numerous as stars' where believers drink to never thirst again (Sahih Muslim 2292). Some will be barred due to post-Prophethood innovations."
    },
    {
      question: "What lessons does this surah teach about enemies of truth?",
      answer: "Allah declares the haters - not the Prophet - were 'cut off.' Historical figures like Al-As ibn Wa'il who mocked him are forgotten, while the Prophet's (ﷺ) name is recited billions of times daily - proving divine promise over worldly taunts."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is worship emphasized after mentioning blessings?",
      answer: "Verse 2 ('Pray and sacrifice') establishes that gratitude for blessings is shown through: 1) Salah (connecting with Allah), and 2) Sacrifice (giving up worldly things for Him). This counters the Quraysh's materialistic worldview."
    },
    {
      question: "How can we apply this surah's message today?",
      answer: "1) Value spiritual over material success, 2) Respond to criticism with patience and worship, 3) Trust Allah's timing - the Prophet's (ﷺ) legacy took centuries to manifest fully, and 4) Express gratitude through consistent ibadah."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is this the shortest yet most powerful surah?",
      answer: "Its 3 verses contain: 1) A divine gift, 2) A worship command, and 3) Eternal justice - encapsulating core Islamic beliefs. The Prophet (ﷺ) smiled when it was revealed (Sahih Muslim), showing its profound comfort despite brevity."
